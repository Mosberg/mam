# Fire Elemental Texture Placeholder

This directory should contain `fire_elemental.png` - a 64x64 pixel texture for the Fire Elemental entity.

The texture should follow Minecraft's humanoid texture layout:

- Head: 0-32, 0-16 (front and back)
- Body: 16-32, 16-32
- Arms: 40-56, 16-32 (right), 32-48, 48-64 (left)
- Legs: 0-16, 16-32 (right), 16-32, 48-64 (left)

Recommended colors for Fire Elemental:

- Base: Orange/red (#FF4500)
- Highlights: Yellow (#FFD700)
- Shadows: Dark red (#8B0000)
- Add emissive glow effect if possible

For now, the entity will use the default player texture until a custom texture is created.
